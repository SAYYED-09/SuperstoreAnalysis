# SuperstoreAnalysis
SuperstoreAnalysis is a data analysis project focused on exploring and gaining insights from a dataset of a fictional supermarket chain's sales data. The dataset contains information on product categories, customers, order dates, sales, profits, shipping costs, and other metrics. 

This project utilizes Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean, process, and visualize the data. Key analysis includes:

- Exploring overall sales trends over time, breaking down performance by product category, customer segment, and geographic region

- Analyzing profits by product category and identifying most and least profitable segments 

- Looking at seasonality and effects of discounts/promotions on sales

- Mapping out distribution of customers across regions

- Building a dashboard with interactive charts to slice data for deeper analysis

The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that could help guide business strategy around inventory, marketing, customer segmentation, and more.
